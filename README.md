# Hi again 👋


Welcome to my Employee Attrition Analysis project! 

This repository is part of my journey to learn more about **data analytics** and its applications in HR. 👩‍💻 

Here, I worked with the (IBM HR Analytics Atrition Dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data], available on Kaggle. It contains data related to employee atrition within an organization, including various personal, professional and organizational attributes. 

The **main goal** is to analyze the reasons behind employee attrition and identify factors influencing turnover.
